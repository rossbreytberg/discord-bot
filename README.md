# discord-bot
A Discord bot for Twitch alerts

# Setup
1. Register a [Discord Bot](https://discord.com/developers/).
Make sure to enable the Server Members Intent. Save the Discord login token for the bot. Invite the bot to your server(s).

2. Register a [Twitch Application](https://dev.twitch.tv/). Save the Twitch client ID and client secret.

3. Install by cloning the repo. Ensure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) on your computer.

4. Open `config.json` and fill in the required fields. If behind a router, make sure any necessary port forwarding is set up.

5. Install dependencies by running `npm install` and start the bot with `node .`.

# Use
Once the bot is in your server, mention it and it will respond with a list of available commands.
